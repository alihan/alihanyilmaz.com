> In this post, I will explain what I did learn from [Wes Bos' JS30 Course](https://javascript30.com/).

<JS30 />

## Overview

[Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/) is one of the best webmasters on the internet. He has a lot of online courses which are some of them paid and some of them free.

I started to learn JavaScript with this course. I built [30 cool things](https://alihan.github.io/JS30/) in 30 days. I'll explain what did I learn week by week. If you want to check source code, [here is my repo](https://github.com/alihan/JS30).

## Week 1

- On day 1, I learned HTML data-\* attributes that give us the ability to embed custom data on HTML elements. I embed custom audio data on several HTML attributes like this:

```html
<div data-key="70" class="key">
  <kbd>F</kbd>
  <span class="sound">openhat</span>
</div>
<audio data-key="70" src="sounds/openhat.wav"></audio>
};
```

- On day 2, I worked with Date objects to build a virtual clock.
- On day 3, I changed some CSS styles with JavaScript.
- On day 4, We did some Array cardio😃 with some JS methods like `filter(), map(), sort(), reduce()`.
- On day 5, More CSS less JavaScript.
- On day 6, Today's project is more attractive. Because I used **Fetch API** and **RegEx** for the first time to display matched cities.
- On last day of week, More cardio🏃🏼, more array. This time, I worked with `some(), every(), find(), findIndex()`,and destructuring.

So, this is just beginning. I know these are not cool as much as I said😏, but just be patient and keep reading. I am sure that you'll find something cool! ⬇️
