> In this post, I will explain what I did learn from [Wes Bos' JS30 Course](https://javascript30.com/).

<JS30 />

## Overview

[Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/) is one of the best webmasters on the internet. He has a lot of online courses which are some of them paid and some of them free.

I started to learn JavaScript with this course. I built [30 cool things](https://alihan.github.io/JS30/) in 30 days. I'll explain what did I learn week by week. If you want to check source code, [here is my repo](https://github.com/alihan/JS30).

## Week 1

- On day 1, I learned HTML data-\* attributes that give us the ability to embed custom data on HTML elements. I embed custom audio data on several HTML attributes like this:

```html
<div data-key="70" class="key">
  <kbd>F</kbd>
  <span class="sound">openhat</span>
</div>
<audio data-key="70" src="sounds/openhat.wav"></audio>
};
```

- On day 2, I worked with Date objects to build a virtual clock.
- On day 3, I changed some CSS styles with JavaScript.
- On day 4, We did some Array cardio🏃🏼 with some JS methods like `filter(), map(), sort(), reduce()`.
- On day 5, More CSS less JavaScript.
- On day 6, Today's project is more attractive. Because I used **Fetch API** and **RegEx** for the first time to display matched cities.
- On the last day of the week, More cardio🏃🏼, more array. This time, I worked with `some(), every(), find(), findIndex()`,and destructuring.

So, this is just the beginning. From now on, it'll become more advance, and cool! ⬇️

## Week 2

- On the first day of the second week, I did cool thing with **Canvas API**. I built something that you can draw with different colors and sizes.🎨
- On day 9, I worked on DevTools. I learned some different things on the console.
- On day 10, Just usual JavaScript. I did a checkbox that you can hold shift and check multiple checkboxes.✅
- On day 11, I built custom HTML5 video player. I worked with **HTMLMediaElement API** to play, stop, and change current time.
- On day 12, I built key sequence detection. Just [click to link](https://alihan.github.io/JS30/key-sequence-detection/index.html) and type hint. 🦄
- On day 13, I did smooth slide images in on scroll.
- On the last day of the this week, I worked with objects and arrays.

This is just half of the way! ⬇️

## Week 3

- On the first day of the third week, I learned **Web Storage API**. It is quite useful for small projects. 👌
- On day 16, We did some math to build something cool and colorful. 🌈
- On day 17, More array methods more RegEx.
- On day 18, Moooore array methods, this time I worked with `map(), split(), reduce()`.
- On day 19, I used Media Streams API, Canvas API to build fun photo filter. 📸
- On day 20, Just [click to link](https://alihan.github.io/JS30/speech-detection/index.html) and say something to mic! 🎙 You'll see what I built. I used **SpeechRecognition API** for the first time. 
- On the last day of the this week, I used **Geolocation API** for the first time. Since I don't have a Mac, I couldn't complete this project.

We are almost done! This week, I worked with a lot of API, and learned too much. ⬇️
